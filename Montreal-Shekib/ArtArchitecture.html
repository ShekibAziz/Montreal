Their mission is to increase awareness of local art while at the same time drawing attention to these desolate urban spaces. Fonderie Darling is part art gallery, part artists studio block, and all heart.</span><br/><br/>

          <span>Galerie de Bellefeuille</span><br/> <span class="parag"> An all-Canadian gallery turned International, Helen and Jacques de Bellefeuille strive to showcase emerging Canadian talent alongside higher-tier artists from around the globe. It was founded in 1980 and has hosted many important events since. Artists like Damien Hirst and Sophie Ryder have seen the walls of de Bellefeuille. It’s become such an important space in the city, that in 2014 they took over a location across the street from the original gallery, dedicating it to 6,500 square feet of contemporary art.</span><br/><br/>
